    CSS frameworks like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> or
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a> are excellent off-the-shelf
    solutions for styling websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    One additional benefit of some CSS frameworks is that you can even reduce
    the size of your CSS bundle with
    <u>tree shaking</u>. <em>Tree shaking</em> is a build-time process that
    optimises your CSS bundles by removing unused styles.

      Tailwind is a "utility-first" CSS framework that provides tree shaking out
      of the box, which helps you develop quickly by avoiding the need to write
      custom classes.
    </summary>
    <p>
      <u>Utility-first</u> refers to how Tailwind provides CSS utilities (e.g.,
      <code>text-blue-500</code>) that can be assembled to make a desired design
      inside of HTML markup, as opposed to writing custom classes with semantic
      naming like <code>card</code> or <code>banner</code>.

      styles that you are not using.

    For my personal website, I have planned to write my own HTML, CSS, and JS as
    much as possible. What follows is my research and integration of tree
    shaking tactics into my website's current build system.
