    Writing can be as tedious as publishing, but the pain of publishing can be
    turned into a quick and easy experience with the help of the right software.
    Sites like Blogger and Medium, as well as products like Wordpress are among
    the easiest and most popular solutions for blogging. In my case, I wanted to
    make my own solution because damn it, I'm a web developer and this is my
    website.
    <u
      ><em
        >How hard can it really be to write software to publish blog posts?</em
      ></u
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    So I took a stab at writing my own solution, that's what I'll describe here
    in this blog post. I sought out to create a solution that matched a few
    criteria that I imagined would be my ideal self-publication experience. In
    particular, I needed my custom blogging software to give me the ability to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>write blog posts in plain HTML, nothing fancy like markdown,</li>
    <li>save my blog posts to files, avoiding the need for databases,</li>
    <li>easily integrate into my current site styles, for consistency,</li>
    <li>avoid javascript frameworks, to keep my site light and quick,</li>
    <li>create the system myself, for the sake of fun.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I realized I needed static site generation.</p>

  <h2>Static Site Generation (SSG)</h2>
  <p>
    What the <em>he||</em> is SSG and why would we use it? Cloudflare
    <a
      href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/"
      >defines SSG as </a
    >...
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ... a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a
    set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator automates the task of
    coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users
    ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very
    quickly in users' browsers.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    So SSG is a tool that generates static files and because those files are
    static, pages load quickly. But what exactly do SSG tools do to generate
    those static files, and when does this process happen? FreeCodeCamp
    <a
      href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/static-site-generation-with-nextjs/"
      >describes SSG as a process of</a
    >
    ...
  </p>
  <blockquote class="margin-tb-20">
    ... compiling and rendering a website or app at build time. The output is a
    bunch of static files, including the HTML file itself and assets like
    JavaScript and CSS.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The same FreeCodeCamp article above mentions
    <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> as an option for applications
    built in React, which would give me excellent control and out-of-the-box
    config for performing SSG.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Unfortunately Next.js is not a good option for me simply because my
      personal website does not use React. I briefly unpacked this tangent,

    <p class="margin-left-20">
      This probably deserves a blog post in-and-of-itself, but for illustration,
      most interactivity on my site is either written in typescript and compiled
      down to a javascript module (e.g., see my
      <a
        href="https://github.com/harleylang/harleys-website/blob/f6e30cd8/www/js/modules/show-html-comments/src/index.ts"
        >show-html-comments</a
      >
      module; it's responsible for
      <a href="../index.html">the HTML comment easter egg on my about page</a>),
      or a small web component (e.g., see my
      <a
        href="https://github.com/harleylang/harleys-website/blob/f6e30cd8/www/js/components/me-carousel/src/index.ts"
        >poloroid-like carousel</a
      >). (And because I wanted my blog posts to be written in HTML, I could
      even write one-off javascript interactivity, like the "cooking recipe"
      easter egg functionality at the beginning of this post.)
    </p>
    <p class="margin-left-20">
      I just haven't written interactivity that requires stateful layers or
      super complex user experiences to justify reaching for javascript
      frameworks (yet). Instead, my use cases are small and discrete, which can
      be perfectly addressed by importing small and discrete global javascript
      modules.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-left-20">
      This allows me to easily add-and-remove scripts to different pages, as
      well as gain a performance boost because each script is bundled and loaded
      separately. So although I am a big fan of React, for now I'd prefer an
      option that will keep my javascript overhead light.
    </p>
  </details>
  <p>
    Anyways, I'm in the mood to build an SSG tool myself with vanilla javascript
    and node. So let's begin.

  <h2 id="meat-and-potatoes">My Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Currently my personal website follows a simple folder structure that is
    traditionally used in server directories, which is recommended in the
    <a
      href="https://modern-web.dev/guides/going-buildless/serving/#serving-web-content"
      >modern web dev</a
    >
    guide:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  www
  └── css
      └──  ... css assets in here
  └── html
      ├── index.html
      └── ... other html
  └── js
      └──  ... js assets in here
</code></pre>
  <p>
    To get started, I updated my <code>package.json</code> with the following
    scripts that will trigger my custom SSG script in two situations, hot module
    reloading and builds:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-json">
  "start": "yarn start:server & yarn start:scss & yarn start:ssg",
  "start:server": "wds --config ./wds.config.mjs --app-index www/html/index.html",
  "start:scss": "sass --no-source-map -w www/css --style compressed",
  "start:ssg": "yarn start:ssg:blog",
  "start:ssg:blog": "esr .bin/watch.mjs --dir www/html/blog --ignore index.html --cmd 'yarn build:ssg:blog'",
  "build": "rm -rf public && yarn build:ssg && yarn sass && rollup -c ./rollup.config.mjs",
  "build:ssg": "yarn build:ssg:blog",
  "build:ssg:blog": "esr .bin/ssg.mjs --template www/html/blog/template.html && prettier --write www/html/blog/**/index.html",
</code></pre>
  <p>A couple critical additions here:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <code>start</code> runs <code>start:ssg</code> and therefore runs
      <code>start:ssg:blog</code> in parallel with other local development
      config.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul class="margin-left-20">
    <li>
      Notice that <code>start:ssg:blog</code> calls <code>.bin/watch.mjs</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Also notice that <code>yarn build:ssg:blog</code> is passed as the "--cmd"
      argument to the <code>.bin/watch.mjs</code> script.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <code>build</code> runs <code>build:ssg</code> and therefore runs
      <code>build:ssg:blog</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul class="margin-left-20">
    <li>
      Notice that <code>build:ssg:blog</code> calls <code>.bin/ssg.mjg</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <code>watch.mjs</code> is a handy script that will watch a directory for
    file changes and trigger a side-effect command in response. In this case,
    the command <code>yarn build:ssg:blog</code> runs in response to file
    changes. Essentially this provides hot module reloading (HMR) in my local
    development environment for all SSG'd content. This means that I can make
    changes to a blog file, save it, and immediately see the SSG'd version of
    that blog post in my browser.

  const [command, ...args] = cmd.split(" ");
  spawn(command, args, {
    stdio: "inherit",

});
</code></pre>
  </details>
  <p>
    For both HMR and builds, I call <code>ssg.mjs</code>. This script requires
    two arguments: "--base" (optional) and "--template". If a base is not
    provided, the template's directory is assumed to be the base directory. The
    template is HTML that includes content "slots" within HTML comments using
    the following syntax: <code>&lt;!--ssg:xyz.html--&gt;</code>. For example,
    <a
      href="https://github.com/harleylang/harleys-website/blob/f6e30cd8/www/html/blog/template.html"
      >here is the template I used when this blog post was generated</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Content slots are identified by parsing the template for the matching
    syntax. For example, if the slot
    <code>&lt;!--ssg:article.html--&gt;</code> is defined, then the SSG script
    will walk recursively from the base directory to find files matching
    "article.html". For each file found that matches the slot, a page is
    generated. If multiple slots are defined and multiple matches are found in a
    specific directory, the content for both files are injected into the
    template and one file is generated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Global slot content can be defined at the base directory. For example, if
    the slot <code>&lt;!--ssg:header.html--&gt;</code> is defined at
    "/base-dir/header.html", then the content within "/base-dir/header.html"
    will be considered the global or fallback content to use for each page. For
    example, if the SSG script finds a directory with only "article.html"
    defined, then the global content for the header defined in
    "/base-dir/header.html" will be used for that page. If however that same
    directory contained a "header.html", that content is used for that slot
    instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a diagram to further illustrate how the script will take a template
    and apply it to all matching slots from the base directory:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-plaintext">
    blog                     -- "base" - nested folders are targeted for iteration
    └── index.html           -- this file is ignored
    └── blog-template.html   -- "template" - this file is the template
    |                             -- within this file are two slots:
    |                             -- &lt;!--ssg:article.html--&gt; and &lt;!--ssg:header.html--&gt;
    └── article.html         -- this is the GLOBAL article slot default / fallback
    |                             -- (global slots are not required; script will fail graciously)
    └── header.html          -- this is the GLOBAL header slot default / fallback
    └── 2020/10                
        └── article.html     -- this is the LOCAL article slot override
        └── index.html       -- SSG'd file w/ LOCAL article and GLOBAL header
    └── 2020/11

        └── header.html      -- this is the LOCAL header slot override
        └── index.html       -- SSG'd file w/ both LOCAL article AND header
</code></pre>
  <p>
    For a more complex example, take a

      >look at my blog directory</a

    as-of the publication of this blog post. (It looks similar to the above
    diagram, but with more slots!)

  <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
  <p>
    It is not much but it'll do. What I have described here is my high-level
    approach to designing a custom SSG tool. Credit owed to
    <a
      href="https://ogzhanolguncu.com/blog/react-ssr-ssg-from-scratch#ssg-on-top-of-ssr"
      >this article that describes SSG in node</a
    >, which I drew a little bit of influence from when creating my solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are certainly opportunities to improve my solution, some ideas of mine
    include:
  </p>
  <ul class="flex flex-column flex-gap-10">
    <li>
      Single Page SSG: rather than recursively generating files from a base
      directory, it would be nice to target just a single directory for cases
      where there may be many subdirectories (e.g., generation on the fly).
    </li>
    <li>
      SSG from a fountain: pull data from a remote source and plug the returned
      content into a template.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hybrid SSG: pull <em>some</em> data from a remote source (e.g., define an
      endpoint within a file to ping, parse, and print).
    </li>
    <li>
      SSR On Top: If the above 3 tasks are implemented then it would be
      interesting to respond to unfound pages within a known SSG target with an
      SSG runner, for SSG on-the-fly. This might be helpful for cases where
      there are hundreds or more entries to generate. (Is this when SSG becomes
      SSR??)
    </li>
    <li>CMS layer, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves.</li>
  </ul>
