    Writing can be as tedious as publishing, but the pain of publishing can be turned
    into a quick and easy experience with the help of the right software. Sites like 
    Blogger and Medium, as well as products like Wordpress are among the easiest and 
    most popular solutions. For me however, I wanted to make my own solution because, 
    well, damn it, this is my website.
    <u><em>How hard can it really be to write software to publish blog posts?</em></u>
  </p>
  <p>
    So I took a stab at writing my own solution, that's what I'll describe here in this
    blog post. And for my ideal self-publication experience, my custom-built software 
    needed to give me the ability to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>write blog posts in plain HTML, nothing fancy like markdown,</li>
    <li>save my blog posts to files, avoiding the need for databases,</li>
    <li>easily integrate into my current site styles, for consistency,</li>
    <li>avoid javascript frameworks, to keep my site light and quick,</li>
    <li>create the system myself, for the sake of fun.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I soon realized what I needed was static site generation.</p>
