    Recently I wanted to start writing technical blog posts about my research on
    various web development topics. Before I began, my first task involved
    researching how I could architect a web environment that would make
    publishing simple and easy to use. So I aimed to meet the following requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I want to write blog posts in plain HTML, nothing fancy like markdown.</li>
    <li>I want to save my blog posts to files, no need for a database at this time.</li>
    <li>I want to create the system myself, for fun.</li>
    <li>I want to avoid javascript frameworks, how hard could it be?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Currently my personal website follows a simple folder structure recommended in the <a href="www/html/blog/2022/vanilla-ssg/article.html">modern web dev</a> guide:
  </p>
  <code>
    www
    └── css
        ├── ... css assets in here
    └── html
        ├── index.html
            │   ├── contact.html
            │   └── index.html
            ├── index.html
    └── js
        ├── ... js assets in here
  </code>
  <p>
    I soon realized I needed was static site generation.
