  <h2>Some Roadworthy Achievements</h2>
  <p>
    The frontend development team at Vertu is poised to become a trend-setting
    digital powerhouse in the UK's automotive industry. Together with our
    backend, design, and marketing team, we are proud to celebrate our websites
    which won the “Dealer Website of the Year” award.

    Our team has celebrated many other wins this year, including the re-launch
    of VansDirect and various internal software and tools that have drifted us
    into the fast lane. There are so many other projects to name and celebrate,
    so I'll leave it to my fellow colleagues to take the stage and share their
    insights on those projects in the weeks to come.

    In the remainder of this blog post, I want to celebrate a few initiatives
    and projects that I was involved in over the past year, either as a
    contributor on one of our amazing teams or as a tech lead of Team Rocket 🚀.
