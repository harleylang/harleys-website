  <h2>Some Roadworthy Achievements</h2>
  <p>
    The frontend development team at Vertu is poised to become a trend-setting
    digital powerhouse in the UK's automotive industry. Together with our
    backend, design, and marketing team, we are proud to celebrate our websites
    which won the ‚ÄúDealer Website of the Year‚Äù award.

    Our team has celebrated many other wins this year, including the re-launch
    of VansDirect and various internal software and tools that have drifted us
    into the fast lane. There are so many other projects to name and celebrate,
    so I'll leave it to my fellow colleagues to take the stage and share their
    insights on those projects in the weeks to come.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the remainder of this blog post, I want to celebrate a few initiatives
    and projects that I was involved in over the past year, either as a
    contributor on one of our amazing teams or as a tech lead of Team Rocket üöÄ.

  <h3>Notable Projects Contributions</h3>
  <p>
    I contributed to various projects over the course of the year. While I
    cannot go into too much detail at this time because the scope of these
    projects are large and their nature is quite innovative, I can share the
    following summary:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      As a contributor with Team Komodo üêâ, we delivered a task queue dashboard
      for tracking the progression of various in-store activities.
    </li>
    <li>
      As the tech lead of Team Rocket üöÄ, we delivered a complete redesign of
      our in-store vehicle presenter. This was a six-month effort that we are
      delighted to roll-out in the coming year. Huge shout out to my fellow
      Rocketeers for all of their hard work, innovation, and creativity!!

  <h3>A Private Package Distribution</h3>
  <p>
    One of my favourite achievements in the past year has been identifying and
    implementing the architecture for a private javascript package distribution.
    This has been a huge undertaking, and I'm really proud of the work we've
    done. Not only has this architecture helped us to better distribute our
    javascript packages internally, but it's also provided a solid foundation
    for future development and growth. It's been a smooth implementation so far
    and we're already seeing some impressive acceleration in terms of code reuse
    and syncronising our various microservices.
  </p>

  <h3>Writing a Foundation for a Component Library</h3>
  <p>
    Another accomplishment I'm proud of is our efforts to write a component
    library that we plan to use for our applications. This has been a long-term
    project with many contributors, but I'm happy to say that we're finally
    starting to see some real progress. The component library we're building
    will provide a consistent, reliable set of tools that we can use across all
    of our applications, which will help to streamline our development process
    and make us more efficient as a team.
  </p>

  <h3>A Template for Success</h3>
  <p>
    One of the projects that I'm most proud of is our internal template or
    boilerplate for our frontend applications. We have created the equivalent of
    ‚Äúcreate-react-app" for our projects to help harmonise configuration and best
    practices across our codebase. This has been a big undertaking, but I'm
    happy to say that it's been a huge success. The template we've created has
    made it much easier for our team to quickly spin up new applications, which
    has saved us a lot of time and effort.

  <h3>Helping to Design and Shape Team Processes</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to working on specific projects, I've also been involved in
    helping to design and shape various team processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together with <u>Lead Developer Steven Blyth</u> and fellow
    <u>Senior Frontend Developer Farshad Shafii</u>, team culture has been an
    import part of our work. This year we have drafted a plan to build the
    fastest, most ambitious, and most impactful team of frontend developers in
    the automotive industry. We believe that our pit crew is tuned to realise
    new gears and take on more complex projects. It has been a pleasure to help
    be involved in molding our team, and I am excited to see what we accomplish
    in one year's time.

  <h3>The Brains Fueling Innovation</h3>
  <p>
    One year ago, I joined Vertu as a junior developer and was immediately
    impressed by the wealth of opportunities available to me. In this time, I
    have been able to supercharge my personal development thanks to the
    incredible team at Vertu. From the frontend team to our colleagues in the
    digitization department, there are so many brilliant minds to learn from and
    create cool stuff with.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to give a special shout out to two of my amazing colleagues, Steven
    Blyth and Farshad Shafii. Steven is a brilliant developer who has taught me
    so much about building production-ready websites. His code is often
    awe-inspiring and sometimes even spiritual to read. Farshad is a brilliant
    developer who was instrumental in introducing me to the team, graciously
    showing me the ropes, and continues to inspire me in so many ways. He is a
    masterful problem-solver and always patient and gracious with his advice and
    sanity checks. I could only hope to emulate half of what these two amazing
    people have achieved.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Vertu, we are like a well-oiled machine, working together to drive
    innovation in the world of automotive digitization. I am proud to be a part
    of this dynamic and forward-thinking team, and there are so many other
    amazing people here who I dare not mention for fear of this turning into an
    Oscar-like speech. What I will say is that I am excited to see what the
    future holds for everyone on our amazing teams!
  </p>

  <h2>One More Special Shout-Out</h2>
  <p>
    I have to give a special mention to Vertu for being so gracious to me,
    especially my managers Steven Blyth, Tom Kirton, and Simon Ward. Not only
    have they provided me with challenging and rewarding work, but they have
    also provided myself and my partner with Visa Sponsorship, enabling us to
    make plans to stay in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future. This is
    a huge relief and we are incredibly grateful.
  </p>

  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
  <p>
    With such an exciting first lap at Vertu, I am looking forward to what is on
    the road ahead for our frontend team. We are settling into a pace that can
    put us in a position to set many more records. For me personally, I feel
    like I'm just getting started and I cannot wait to find my next gear in the
    coming year.
