        <!-- Hellooo from the otherrrr ssiiIIIIiiide -->
        <p>
          Welcome to my website. My name is Harley. I'm a Canadian living in
          Scotland, a former behaviour analyst working as a web developer, and an
          aspiring couch potato. (I'll get there one day!)
        </p>
        <!-- Aren't biographies fun!? -->
        <p>
          I bet you are not wondering how I ended up making websites in Scotland.
          Some say it was the pandemic, others say it was
          <abbr title="You only live once">YOLO</abbr> fever. I have my own
          theories on the matter, but I believe it was someone important who once
          said: when life gives you lemons, the lemonade is always sweeter on the
          other side.
        </p>
        <!-- Nice little malaphor for you; I'm something of a poet myself. -->
        <p>
          Anyway, I might put more content here in the future. I probably won't
          put more content here in the future. All I can guarantee is this dark
          mode button, behold:
        </p>
        <!-- It makes me employable. -->
        <div class="darkmode-toggle__wrapper">
          <code htmlCommentToggle>&lt;!--</code>
          <me-darkmode-toggle></me-darkmode-toggle>
          <code htmlCommentToggle>--&gt;</code>
        </div>
        <p>beoOOOOOoOOOOooppP,</p>

          PS: If you are a fellow technology enthusiast looking to see how the sausage is made, 
          check out my website repository on github: www.github.com/harleylang/harleys-website

          I have worked with a lot of technology:
          - jquery
          - javascript
          - nodejs
          - v a n i l l a j a v a s c r i p t
          - express
          - react
          - angular
          - svelte
          - web components
          - css
          - sass
          - v a n i l l a c s s
          - html
          - vanilla html
          - and server stuff like aws, php, sql
          
          And if you have read this far, I hope you have seen through my humourous candour.

          I love coding. I love mentoring junior devs. I love going into work and contributing value.
          
          Others will tell you about how my previous experience in education brings a unique spin to how I approach my work.
          - I am empathetic. I listen, understand, and act to improve team and stakeholder wellbeing.
          - I am professional. I stay sharp, I over deliver on expectations, and I always support the team. 
          - I am a leader. I can rapidly build rapport, communicate, and initiate projects that are people powered.

          I am not currently looking for work. I love my team and the organization I work for. 
          
          But if you love technology like I do, please feel free to get in touch!

          PPS: People frequently write me and say things like, 
          <blockquote>
            Hi Harley! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Hoc ovum paschale est. Sed non facilisis est. 
            Necesse est lectori latine legere. Et hoc scire debetis. Quam verisimile est quod 
            aliquis hunc locum interpretabitur? Ergo impossibile est cognoscere.
          </blockquote> 
          So this is a delivery to you, the fans. HL - 2022-07-31
