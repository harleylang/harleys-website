        Welcome to my website. My name is Harley. I'm a Canadian living in
        Scotland, a former behaviour analyst working as a web developer, and an
        aspiring couch potato. (I'll get there one day!)
        <!-- Aren't biographies fun!? -->
      </p>
      <p>
        I bet you are not wondering how I ended up making websites in Scotland.
        Some say it was the pandemic, others say it was YOLO fever. I have my
        own theories on the matter, but I believe it was someone important who
        once said: when life gives you lemons, the lemonade is always sweeter on
        the other side.
        <!-- Nice little malaphor for you; I'm something of a poet myself. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I might put more content here in the future. I probably won't
        put more content here in the future. All I can guarantee is this dark
        mode button, behold:<!-- It makes me employable. -->
      </p>
      <div class="DarkmodeToggle__wrapper">
        <code>&lt;!--</code>
        <me-darkmode-toggle></me-darkmode-toggle>
        <code>--&gt;</code>
      </div>

      PS: If you are a fellow technology enthusiast looking to see how the sausage is made, 
      check out my website repository on github: www.github.com/harleylang/harleys-website

      I have worked with a lot of technology:
      - aws
      - php
      - sql
      - jquery
      - javascript
      - nodejs
      - v a n i l l a j a v a s c r i p t
      - express
      - react
      - angular
      - svelte
      - web components
      - css
      - sass
      - v a n i l l a c s s
      - html
      - vanilla html
      - and much more!
      
      And if you have read this far, I hope you can see through my humourous candour.

      I love coding. I love mentoring junior devs. I love going into work and contributing value.
      
      Others will tell you about how my previous experience in education brings a unique spin to how I approach my work.
      - I am empathetic. I listen, understand, and act to improve team and stakeholder wellbeing.
      - I am professional. I stay sharp, I over deliver on expectations, and I always support the team. 
      - I am a leader. I can rapidly build rapport, communicate, and initiate projects that are people powered.

      I am not currently looking for work. I love my team and the organization I work for. 
      
      But if you love technology like I do, please feel free to get in touch!
